# 🍽️ RestaurantSaaS — Multi-Tenant Restaurant Management Platform

A full-featured, multi-tenant **Restaurant Management SaaS Platform** built with **Laravel 12** and **React 18**. Designed for restaurant owners to manage menus, orders, tables, vouchers, kitchen displays, settlements, and more — all behind a subscription-based model managed by a super admin.

Current stable release: **v1.0.0**

Customers scan a **QR code** at their table, browse the menu, place orders, and pay — all from their phone. Staff and kitchen see orders in real-time via **Pusher** broadcasting.

## 🔄 Order Workflow

```
placed → confirmed → preparing → ready → served → completed
                                                  ↘ cancelled
```

Orders flow through these stages with real-time broadcasting at each step. Kitchen staff advance orders through the KDS interface, and customers see live updates on their tracking page.

---

3. **Add to Cart** with quantity selection
4. **Apply Voucher** (optional discount code)
5. **Choose Payment** — Cash at counter or Online
6. **Place Order** — validated against WiFi network (optional)
7. **Track Order** — real-time status updates via WebSocket
8. **View Invoice** — POS-style receipt, downloadable/printable
